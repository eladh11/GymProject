  <h4>1. Barbell Bench Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: You can generate the most power with barbell lifts, so
    the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight. It's also an
    easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells. The exercise is
    easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master), There are plenty
    of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Do it toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets
    in lower rep ranges. Consider varying your grip width for more complete
    chest development.

  <h4>2. Flat Bench Dumbbell Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: With dumbbells, each side of your body must work
    independently, which recruits more stabilizer muscles; dumbbells are harder
    to control than a barbell. Dumbbells also allow for a longer range of motion
    than the barbell bench press, both at the bottom and top of the movement.
    Flat dumbbell presses allow you to hoist a fairly heavy weight, and they
    make for a good alternative if you've been stuck on the barbell bench for
    ages.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Do flat dumbbell presses toward the start of your chest
    workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. We don't typically recommend
    doing dumbbell presses in addition to the barbell bench press, because both
    moves are so similar. In fact, the similar nature of these movements was
    confirmed via electromyography (EMG) analysis, which demonstrated no
    significant differences between flat-bench dumbbell and barbell in regard to
    muscle activation.

  <h4>3. Low-Incline Barbell Bench Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which
    requires a larger contribution from the front delts than the chest to move
    the weight.[2] If possible, go for a less-steep incline to hit the upper
    pecs without as much stress on the delts. You can also easily do low-incline
    benches with an adjustable bench on the Smith machine. If you're really
    looking to build that shelf of an upper chest, EMG results have suggested
    that bringing your grip in a bit closer may hammer upper-chest fibers
    significantly more.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Many chest workouts start with flat-bench movements first,
    then progress to inclines, but it's time to get out of that bad habit. Every
    so often, start with inclines. The benefit is that you'll be fresher and can
    lift more weight, which puts a greater amount of stress on the upper pec
    fibers and could lead to more growth.

  <h4>4. Machine Decline Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Some machines, like Hammer Strength, allow you to move
    each arm independently, which is a great feature on chest day. Besides doing
    a machine decline press straight on, you can sit sideways on the apparatus
    and press across your body one arm at a time, which delivers a completely
    different feel than when you sit straight-on.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the primary muscle actions of the pec major is transverse
    adductionâ€”think cable flyes or pec-deck flyes to understand this action. By
    sitting in a sideways position, you can maximize your press with a
    pec-dominant horizontal adduction, effectively getting more from the
    movement. In your workout: Do free-weight exercises first in your chest
    workout because they require more effort and stabilizer muscles than
    machines. With that in mind, this could be the last multijoint exercise in
    your routine.

  <h4>5. Seated Machine Chest Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great,
    but the machine press has some unique benefits. For one, it's easier to slow
    down the repetition, both in the concentric and eccentric phases.
    Stack-loaded machines are also great for quickly doing dropsets. EMG
    research demonstrates that the machine bench press recruits much less of the
    three heads of the deltoid (anterior, middle, and posterior) than
    free-weight variations because of a decreased need for humeral
    stabilization.[3] This allows you to really target your pecs.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Again, do machine exercises at the end of your workout. For
    anyone looking to build mass, machines give you a greater chance to pump
    your pecs with minimal shoulder assistance.

  <h4>6. Incline Dumbbell Press</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Dumbbell presses make everybody's top 10 list, but
    with an adjustable bench you can do a number of things you can't with a
    fixed bench. Our favorite: changing the angle of the incline from one set to
    the next, or from one workout to the next. Hitting a muscle from varying
    degrees of incline angles builds it more thoroughly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: This is an occasional first movement, but it can easily go
    anywhere from first to third in your routine. Keep in mind, though, that the
    later you do this movement, the less weight you'll likely be able to push.
    For even crazier pumps with this exercise, try to slowly rotate the
    dumbbells from palms-forward to a palms-inward position during the
    concentric portion of the lift, really squeezing at the top. This slight
    change will cause you to medially rotate the upper arm, really recruiting
    your pec major.

  <h4>7. Dips For Chest</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: First off, make sure you're doing dips that emphasize
    the pecs: Put your feet up behind you, lean forward as far as possible, and
    allow your elbows to flare out as you dip. Chest dips are a great
    spotter-free alternative to the decline press.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: If you're strong, this lower-chest move makes a great
    finisher; if you're not, you can do it earlier in your session. It makes a
    great superset pairing with push-ups for a big pump at the end of your
    workout.

  <h4>8. Incline Bench Cable Fly</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Not many single-joint exercises made the list, but
    this is one of our favorites. It's an effective move to isolate the pecs
    after completing your multijoint exercises. Cables allow for continuous
    tension throughout the exercise's full range of motion. If you've got a good
    chest pump going, nothing beats looking back at yourself in the mirror as
    you squeeze out a few more reps.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Do incline cable flyes at the end of your workout for
    slightly higher reps (sets of 10-12). If you're training with a partner, do
    a few dropsets for some real masochistic, muscle-building fun!

  <h4>9. Incline Dumbbell Pull-Over</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Forget flat-bench pull-overs; the incline version puts
    your chest fibers under tension for a longer range of motion! Just sit back
    against a bench inclined to about 45 degrees and make sure the dumbbell
    clears the top. Make sure you keep this a single-joint movement; don't bend
    or extend at the elbows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, you should have a specific reason for each movement you complete.
    Pull-over exercises work the shoulder-extension movement pattern (moving the
    upper arm rearward), which can really torch the pecs since they're one of
    the primary muscle groups involved in this action! In your workout: Do
    pull-overs at the very end of your workout for sets of 12. On every set,
    hold the peak contraction of the last rep for a full five seconds.

  <h4>10. Pec-Deck Machine</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Chest flyes are hard for many trainees to learn with
    dumbbells or cables because the arms need to be locked in a slightly bent
    position for the duration of the exercise. Luckily, the pec deck simplifies
    things because it allows you to work in only one pathway. So, this exercise
    is a great movement teacher, and you can go for a great pump without having
    to balance any weights. EMG data shows that activation of the pectoralis
    major and anterior delt are statistically similar between the pec deck and
    bench press, which means that even though you'll probably be working in
    different rep ranges for each exercise, you'll get great chest activation
    from this machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    In your workout: Hit the pec deck last in your chest routine for sets of
    10-12. Do dropsets and partial reps, pumping out as many as you can to
    failure.
