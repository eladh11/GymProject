  <h4 class="hh4">10 killer exercises for the back</h4>
  <img src="../../../assets/back.jpg" width="380" height="432" />

  <h4>1. Barbell Deadlift</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: This is technically more than a back exercise—it hits
    the entire posterior chain from your calves to your upper traps—but it's the
    absolute best for overall backside development. Technique is uber-important
    with the deadlift, but once you nail it, you can progress to lifting monster
    weights that will recruit maximum muscle, release muscle-building hormones,
    and help you get big.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also numerous deadlift progression programs you can follow to help
    you reach new personal bests. Physiologists love to prescribe the deadlift
    when programming for strength and conditioning because the exercise hammers
    your musculature and is one of the best choices to strengthen your bone
    structure.

  <h4>2. Bent-Over Barbell Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: This is probably the second-best back movement in
    terms of sheer weight you can lift. EMG research has suggested that hitting
    bent-over barbell rows will work the larger muscle groups of the upper and
    lower back equally, making this a great overall back builder.[2] Like the
    deadlift, this is another technical move that requires excellent form but
    rewards you with a ton of muscle.

  <h4>3. Wide-Grip Pull-Up</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling
    movement in your back routine, and the pull-up is one of the best. Wide-grip
    pull-ups are excellent for putting emphasis on the upper lats. A closer grip
    may allow for a longer range of motion, but it may be possible to load the
    wide-grip pull-up to a greater degree because of an optimized starting joint
    position. The biggest challenge here for most trainers is training to
    failure in the right rep range for growth, which is 8-12.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do pull-ups early in your workout, you might have to add a weighted
    belt. Of course, if you find them difficult, you can always use an assisted
    pull-up machine or a good spotter, or switch to the wide-grip pull-down,
    which is a solid substitute. If your shoulders are healthy, pulling behind
    the head is okay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good form is extremely important here. In the starting position, the scapula
    should be retracted—pull your shoulder blades down and toward each
    other—prior to initiating the pull.

  <h4>4. Standing T-Bar Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: We selected the T-bar row over a chest-supported
    version because you can pile on much more weight here, even though that
    typically translates into a bit of cheating through the knees and hips. For
    some, maintaining a flat back can be challenging, in which case the
    supported version is a better choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    These aren't squats, so keep your legs locked in a bent angle throughout.
    You also typically have a choice of hand positions and width. A wider grip
    will put more emphasis on the lats, while a neutral grip will better target
    the middle back (rhomboids, teres, and traps). This exercise is probably one
    of the easier rows to spot.

  <h4>5. Wide-Grip Seated Cable Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Just about everyone defaults to the close-grip bar on
    rows. If that sounds like you, you'll find using a wide grip on a lat bar a
    nice change of pace because it shifts some of the emphasis to the upper
    lats. Wide rows mimic some back machines, so don't do both in your workout
    unless you make some other kinds of changes, like grip or target rep range.
    You might even try flipping your grip—and going about shoulder-width
    apart—which better targets the lower lats as the elbows stay tighter to your
    sides.

  <h4>6. Reverse-Grip Smith Machine Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Reverse-grip movements mean two things: The biceps
    play a greater role, and with the elbows now pulling back close to your
    sides, the target becomes the lower portion of the lats. The Smith machine
    allows you to concentrate only on pulling as much weight as possible, since
    you don't have to worry about balancing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Bend over about 45 degrees, staying close to the bar, and expect a little
    contribution from the hips and knees when you're pounding out the heavy
    sets. While some gym rats consider the Smith machine taboo, the fixed plane
    of the movement and ability to really control a weight (think tempo of four
    seconds up and four down) can be both a novel and humbling exercise.

  <h4>7. Close-Grip Pull-Down</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Since we've already covered the wide-grip pull-up, the
    wide-grip pull-down is too similar, so we opted for the close-grip handle
    for our pull-down selection. EMG research suggests that use of a close
    neutral grip activates the lats similarly to a regular grip, so you're not
    missing out on any muscle fibers.[3] As mentioned earlier with pull-ups, a
    closer grip does allow for a longer range of motion and increased time under
    tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle.

  <h4>8. Single-Arm Dumbbell Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: This is a great unilateral exercise—each side works
    independently—that allows you to move a lot of weight. You'll get greater
    range of motion when training unilaterally, and you won't be restrained if
    your weaker side fails first. You may also be better able to support your
    lower back—which may have taken plenty of punishment by now—when placing one
    hand on a bench. Allowing a slight degree of rotation of the trunk may
    engage a greater degree of "core" musculature, as well.[2]

  <h4>9. Decline Bench Dumbbell Pull-Over</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: Pull-overs for back? Absolutely! This one mimics the
    straight-arm cable pull-down you're probably familiar with. Yes, this is a
    single-joint move, but it allows you to really target and torch your lats.
    The decline version puts your lats under tension for a longer range of
    motion than when using a flat bench. Just make sure the dumbbell clears your
    head, and drop it on the floor behind you when you're done.

  <h4>10. Single-Arm Smith Machine Row</h4>

  <p>
    Why it's on the list: This bad boy is basically a single-arm dumbbell row
    performed on a Smith machine. It's a great and novel choice for your lower
    lats. Stand sideways to the machine, grasping the bar toward the middle, and
    keep your body close to the apparatus using a split stance and bent knees
    for balance. As you pull the bar up as high as you can, your body may sway a
    bit to keep the movement natural, which is OK.
